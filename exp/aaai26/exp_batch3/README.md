# Experiment Batch 3: Same Goals, Different Initial States

This folder contains the third batch of experiments for the project.

- This batch tests GNN-based heuristics against problem with identical goals but varying initial states.
- For each goal, a dedicated model is trained and then used to solve all instances that share that same goal.
- All models of interest are located in the `models` subfolder.
- Scripts to run multiple experiments and aggregate results are provided in the `scripts` subfolder.
