# Experiment Batch 4: Scalability Testing

This folder contains the fourth batch of experiments for the project.

- This batch tests GNN-based heuristics in terms of scalability.
- We have generated instances with increasing goal length to see if GNN is able to generalize and allow the solver to scale.
- All models of interest are located in the `_models` subfolder.
- Scripts to run multiple experiments and aggregate results are provided in the `_scripts` subfolder.
