# deep

**deep** (Dynamic Epistemic logic-basEd Planner) is a multi-agent epistemic planner that operates over the full scope of mA*, leveraging optimized search algorithms and heuristics. It is designed for scalable planning in multi-agent domains, supporting advanced reasoning over knowledge and belief.

For a more detailed overview, please take a look at the works referenced in the Bibliography section at the end of this README.

## AAAI
To replicate the experiments please follow the instruction in exp/aaai26 using the provided pre-trained models.

## Features

- Multi-agent epistemic planning using Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL)
- Optimized search strategies: BFS, DFS, A*, etc.
- Support for heuristics, including optional neural network-based heuristics
- Modular and extensible C++ codebase
- Templated heuristics and flexible state representations

> Note: EPDDL support is planned but not yet integrated. The current version works with the `mA*` language.

## Requirements

- C++20 compiler (e.g., g++ 10+, clang 11+)
- CMake 3.14 or higher
- Boost (header-only)
- Bison and Flex
- Python 3.6+ (for optional scripts and comparisons)
- ONNX Runtime (installed automatically through build script) (optional, for neural network heuristics)
- LaTeX (optional, for PDF state visualization)
- Doxygen (optional, for documentation generation)
- GraphViz  (optional, for PDF state visualization and documentation generation)


> CUDA is **not required**. GPU support via ONNX Runtime with CUDA is available but **not tested**.

### Linux Dependencies

Install required tools and libraries:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake bison flex libboost-dev unzip curl

## Build Instructions

### Clone the repository

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FrancescoFabiano/deep.git
    cd deep

The `--recurse-submodules` flag ensures that all submodules (like CLI11) are cloned as well.

### Build the project

Use the build script with `-h` to view all available options:

    ./build.sh -h

For example, a simple release build:

    ./build.sh

Or a release build with neural networks enabled:

    ./build.sh nn

#### CMake Build Options

You can customize the build using these options:

- `ENABLE_NEURALNETS=ON` ‚Äì Enable ONNX Runtime for heuristic inference
- `ENABLE_CUDA=ON`       ‚Äì Attempt to enable CUDA inference if CUDA Toolkit is found

Example:

    cmake .. -DENABLE_NEURALNETS=ON -DENABLE_CUDA=OFF

> CUDA acceleration is supported if available, but **not required or tested**.


## Usage

Common `make` targets after building:

    make             # Compile the planner
    make doxygen     # Generate documentation (see docs/html/index.html)
    make clean       # Remove build files
    make clean_build # Remove build and binary directories
    make clean_out   # Remove output files (e.g., PDF visualizations)
    make clear       # Clean both build and output files
    make fresh       # Clean everything, including documentation

If built in a different folder from root, for example `cmake-build-release`, run with -C option like this for documentation generation:

    make -C cmake-build-release doxygen

## Execution Examples

Assuming the binary is located at `./cmake-build-release/bin/deep`, here are some example commands you can run in your terminal:

```console
# Use '-h' or '--help' to see all options (this option is automatically activated when wrong arguments are parsed)
./cmake-build-release/bin/deep -h

# Find a plan for domain.txt
./cmake-build-release/bin/deep domain.txt

# Plan using the heuristic 'SUBGOALS' and 'Astar' search
./cmake-build-release/bin/deep domain.txt -s Astar --heuristic SUBGOALS

# Execute actions [open_a, peek_a] step by step
./cmake-build-release/bin/deep domain.txt -e --execute-actions open_a peek_a

# Run 3 planner configurations in parallel (portfolio search)
./cmake-build-release/bin/deep domain.txt --portfolio_threads 3
```



## Scripts

Helper scripts for testing and debugging are located in the `scripts/` directory.
All scripts contain a `-h` or `--help` option to display usage information.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks are available in the `exp/` directory.
